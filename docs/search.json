    "text": "Ultrarunning & Eating\nSince the UK lockdown in March 2020 I’ve caught the running bug. Last year, I completed my first marathon, and I have signed up to two marathons this year. The marathon is—obviously—a tough distance; but some (crazy) people run Ultra-marathons which is any race longer than the 26.2 miles of a standard marathon.\nIf you’re training for an ultra-marathon, you probably want to make sure your diet during your training is good to ensure you are getting the necessary nutrients and energy. It’s not untypical for ultra-runners to consume anywhere between 3,000 to 6,000 calories a day during training. As for macro-nutrient recommendations, the guidelines for ultra-runners are not very different from those for other endurance athletes. The general recommendation for endurance athletes is as follows:\n\nCarbohydrates: 45-65% of total daily calories.\nProtein: 15-20% of total daily calories.\nFats: 20-35% of total daily calories.\n\nLet’s say you’re interested in making a daily log of your total daily calorie intake together with tracking your macro-nutrients. For each day, how did each of the macro-nutrients (i.e., the part) contribute to total calorie intake (i.e., the whole)?"

    "text": "Different Visualisations\n\nBar plot\nAhh the good old humble bar plot. Not really useful for a part-to-whole visualisation (ha! Suddenly I’m a know-it-all on part-to-whole visualisations), but here it is anyway:\n\nbar &lt;- data %&gt;% \n  filter(source != \"total\") %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = value, group = source)) + \n  geom_col(aes(fill = source), \n           position = \"dodge\") + \n  labs(x = NULL, \n       y =\"Calories Consumed\", \n       fill = NULL)\nbar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot bad, but it’s hard to differentiate the different days during the month.\n\n\nStacked column plot\nA stacked column plot is similar to the bar plot but the bars are—you guessed it—stacked on top of each other:\n\nstacked_column &lt;- data %&gt;% \n  filter(source != \"total\") %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = value)) + \n  geom_col(aes(fill = source)) + \n  labs(x = NULL, \n       y =\"Calories Consumed\", \n       fill = NULL)\nstacked_column\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is clearly better than the bar plot. One useful aspect of this plot is that we get multiple points of information: The height of each column shows the total calories consumed (the whole), and the colours represent the macros that make up that total (the part). It’s very basic, but it’s functional.\n\n\nPolar plot\nI am not sure if this is the correct term for it, but you can wrap the column plot around polar coordinates using coord_polar() in ggplot. This makes it look snazzier, but I am not sure it is more informative.\n\npolar &lt;- data %&gt;% \n  filter(source != \"total\") %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = value)) + \n  geom_col(aes(fill = source)) + \n  coord_polar() +\n  labs(x = NULL, \n       y =\"Calories Consumed\", \n       fill = NULL)\npolar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s definitely snazzier, and you still retain a feel for the total calories consumed each day. It is harder to ready the y-axis (calories consumed) for each point, and whilst we’re at it the x-axis (date) isn’t that clear either.\nWe also get an idea of the macro contributions to the total, but in the current plot this isn’t completely satisfactory because it’s hard to visualise the category with the smallest proportion (protein). To address this we can reverse the ordering on the geom_col() call using the position argument so that the category with the smallest contribution is on the outer section of each column.\n\npolar_reversed &lt;- data %&gt;% \n  filter(source != \"total\") %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = value)) + \n  geom_col(aes(fill = source), \n           position = position_stack(reverse = TRUE)) + \n  coord_polar() +\n  labs(x = NULL, \n       y =\"Calories Consumed\", \n       fill = NULL)\npolar_reversed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere they are all next to each other:\n\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\nWarning: package 'patchwork' was built under R version 4.2.3\n\n(bar + stacked_column) / (polar + polar_reversed)"
