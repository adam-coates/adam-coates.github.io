### About


Hello, I'm Adam a PhD student in Cognitive Psychology at the University of Graz, Austria.

I am currently interested in the function of the human claustrum and aim to uncover the claustrum's function in humans using functional magnetic resonance imaging. 



------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before moving to Austria, I studied at [Keele University, UK](https://www.keele.ac.uk/) and finished BSc in Psychology in 2018 and continued Masters study in 2019.
