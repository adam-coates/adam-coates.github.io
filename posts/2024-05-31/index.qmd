### WPS office 

- I've been experimenting with linux recently quite a lot and I really am enjoying the setup that I have right now 

- One of the things I didn't think I actually would miss but I kind of do a bit is Microsoft Office 

- The upside to linux however is that there is free programs that try to replace Microsoft Offices ridiculously priced Office program bundle

- This is great, however these free programs don't quite cut the mustard 

### Libre office

- Libre office is okay, it has some of the features that Microsoft Office applications have but not all 

- The UI is terrible though (especially if you're someone like me who comes from Microsoft Office's UI) the UI seems really outdated

- But Microsoft Offices UI also has quite a number of shortcomings and I found that I really hate the whole idea of ribbons and trying to find something really specific oftentimes leads to some googling (and now probably some chatGPT-ing)


> But there is a trick to get the UI in LibreOffice to look better and more like Microsoft Offices

- Libre Office also natively supports Zotero

- But over all there is just a massive lack of features in Libre Office (I won't list all of them but when creating a presentation recently I found a lot of missing things that made making a presentation really difficult and so I had to spin-up my windows machine instead)


### WPS office

- Then I came across a reddit thread in the Linux community that specifically discussed the available alternatives to Microsoft Office in Linux

- I found WPS office and was pleasantly surprised at the number of features that it really has 

- But one thing that it doesn't support is a zotero plugin

- I came across this thread with others like me that were disappointed by this: [WPS Office integration with zotero](https://forums.zotero.org/discussion/87141/wps-office-integration)



### WPS Office plugin for zotero

- There appears to be a zotero plugin made on github 

It was easy to install by following these steps 

    1. git clone https://github.com/tankwyn/WPS-Zotero.git
    2. cd WPS-Zotero
    3. ./install.py

... and that's it

Straight out of the box the plugin works for WPS Office

### Maybe time to write using latex? 

- I have thought about this for a while 

- I use neovim and do a lot of writing just using markdown files 

- I think that I would really like to be able to move entirely away from relying on a word processor program but for things like making presentations I don't see any other alternatives than either using online Microsoft Office, Google docs, Libre Office or WPS Office


- In neovim I can create and automatically preview markdown files in a browser 

- I can then use the zotero plugin to put references into the markdown file from zotero 

- I can then convert this markdown file to a .pdf or .docx with a filter to render the references from the zotero plugin first, and then a second filter to render these references into apa style for example:

> `pandoc test.md -o test.pdf -F otref.py --citeproc --csl /mnt/g/apa.csl`

- Then with some yaml header and some additional formatting specific to latex and/ or pandoc rendering inside the document itself its possible to get a document that looks pretty nice 

- Pandoc additionally supports some html tags too for example: 

> `<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">This will be in small caps!</span>`

(Even quarto renders the html tags, but this makes sense since it is essentially a wrapper for pandoc that also executes and runs r and python code <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">This will be in small caps!</span>`)


Therefore I think in the future I will be switching to using just a markdown editor like neovim will be beneficial in the long run. It makes sense that the idea of a word processor is to write words and not to be spend hours upon hours formatting and getting everything to look pretty.
