### What started the move form windows to Linux?
#### Windows 10 is not being supported from October 2025

I used to enjoy using windows and this year, 2024, I have been using Linux more and more. Today I realised I haven't needed or wanted to use Windows now for more than half a year and therefore, I decided to completely get rid of windows entirely. 

This has a few benefits (not to mentioned the freed up storage space) 

But I think the main concern that many have (includiung myslef) is that there would be sucha alarge learning curve that would hinder the somewhat ease-of-use work flow that exists on a windows operating system 

I decided to jump into the deep end and start with Arch linux. My thoughts were that I want a system that is completely customisable, a system whereby I would really learn the full ins and outs about the linux OS all the while having arguable the most extensive package managers available right now `pacman`

### Installing Arch Linux

- Arch linux can literally be installed how you like it to be from the get go including what drives to partition, how much to partition them by whether you want `x` number of partitions etc. Or perhaps you want to have some drive that is formated as ext4 while others as btfs. 

- Arch linux comes with a simple to use and straightforward installation guide and there are many YouTube videos and documentation documenting how exactly to install linux
